ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Qingtian Zou (é‚¹æ“Žå¤©).

ðŸ‘€ I am a machine learning practioner. I have been applying traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve problems mainly in the security domain. I am also interested in problems centering traditional machine learning and deep learning, like AI risks, explainability, roubustness, etc.

Some projects I contributed to (excluding those created by me, which you can find in my repositories):
- https://github.com/PSUCyberSecurityLab/AIforCybersecurity (the whole chapter 5)
- https://github.com/slundberg/shap
