👋 Hi, I’m Qingtian Zou (邹擎天).

👀 I am a machine learning practioner. I have been applying traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve problems mainly in the security domain. I am also interested in problems centering traditional machine learning and deep learning (like AI risks, explainability, roubustness, etc.) and their applications in other domains like biomedical sciences.

Some projects I contributed to (excluding those created by me, which you can find in my repositories):
- https://github.com/PSUCyberSecurityLab/AIforCybersecurity (the whole chapter 5)
- https://github.com/slundberg/shap
- https://github.com/secdev/scapy

Highlighted project:
- [PM-BDSP-GrandUndergroundMining](https://github.com/Qingtian-Zou/PM-BDSP-GrandUndergroundMining): A reinforcement learning environment and playable web game inspired by the mining minigame from Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl's Grand Underground.
- [auto-llm-predictor](https://github.com/Qingtian-Zou/auto-llm-predictor): An agentic framework to automatically build a fine-tuned LLM predictor from any CSV dataset.
